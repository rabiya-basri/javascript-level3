        <h1>INTERNET</h1>
        <em>..</em>
        <p>The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses
            the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network
            of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local 
            to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 
            The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext
            documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing. <br/><br/>
        
                The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research
                commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of 
                computers.[1] The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for 
                interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of the
                National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private 
                funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development
                of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks.[2] The linking of 
                commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition
                    to the modern Internet,[3] and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional,
                    personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by academia 
                    in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.
